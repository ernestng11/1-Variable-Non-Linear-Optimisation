# 1-Variable-Non-Linear-Optimisation

In this file, I have included iterative methods to find/approximate stationary in smooth/non-smooth functions. These algorithms cover Bisection method, Newton's method and Golden Section method.

For Multi-Dimensional Unconstrained minimisation problems, I implemented the Steepest Descent Method with several techniques such as exact line search and Armijo's Rule.

Njoy!
